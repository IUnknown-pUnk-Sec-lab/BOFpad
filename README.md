# BOFpad - Notepad TabState Decoder (BOF)

BOFpad is a Beacon Object File (BOF) that extracts and decodes saved tab state data from Windows 11/10 Notepad. It scans the Notepad TabState directory, extracts .bin files, and attempts to recover UTF-16LE or ASCII content to help analysts or red teamers understand what was left in open Notepad tabs â€” even if the tabs were unsaved.

## What It Does

Locates the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsNotepad_* directory

Searches for .bin files under LocalState\TabState

Extracts readable content from each file:

Attempts UTF-16LE decoding

Falls back to ASCII if needed

Outputs sanitized, line-wrapped, safe strings directly to the C2 channel

## Example Output
